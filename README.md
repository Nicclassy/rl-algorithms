## rl-algorithms
This repository contains an implementation of two of the most common reinforcement learning algorithms: Q-learning and SARSA. The program allows for customisation of algorithm parameters (e.g. number of episodes and epsilon) as well as environment parameters (e.g. the size of the board, where the agent starts and where the goal is located). The code was written as an exercise in reinforcement learning.

The screenshots below demonstrate some output from the program.
